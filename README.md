Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease. 

Using the visualization, we explore how habits of physical activity, person’s age, and daily technology usage as factors could possibly have an impact on heart/cardiovascular diseases. We take into account the BMI (Body Mass Index) which helps us identify whether a person’s weight is in line with other parameters and how people within these BMI categories are prone to Cardiovascular diseases. 

Through this visualization, the user will be guided through a curated data exploration into understanding such trends. Hopefully, it may even serve to raise awareness on the severity of such issues around the world.
